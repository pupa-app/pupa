# Changelog

All notable changes to the Pupa iOS / macOS repo are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) — patch-only bumps (`0.0.X` → `0.0.X+1`).

## [0.0.2] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Launch splash no longer lets the app show through (opaque backing
  behind the brand gradient) and now plays as a strict sequence: splash
  fades fully out onto a neutral surface before the onboarding fades in,
  so the splash and onboarding never blend and the app never flashes
  during the handoff. (`PupaApp` `0.0.90`)

## [0.0.1] — 2026-06-01

### Added

- Initial extraction of the Pupa iOS / macOS client into a standalone
  repo. Contains the SwiftUI app (`Pupa/` — `PupaApp` `0.0.89`), the
  standalone AG-UI Swift Package (`AGUIKit/` — `0.0.20`), the Xcode host
  project (`PupaHost/`) used for TestFlight builds, the
  `testflight-release` skill under `.claude/skills/`, and the
  architecture + "adding a new component" docs.

  Internal sub-package versions (in `Pupa/Sources/PupaApp/Version.swift`
  and `AGUIKit/Sources/AGUIKit/Version.swift`) carry forward from the
  monorepo so TestFlight build tracking and AGUIKit consumers keep
  working. Only the **root project version** restarts at `0.0.1` here.
  The backend now lives in its own repo
  ([pupa-app/pupa-backend](https://github.com/pupa-app/pupa-backend)).
