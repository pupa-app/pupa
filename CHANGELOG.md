# Changelog

All notable changes to the Pupa iOS / macOS repo are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) — patch-only bumps (`0.0.X` → `0.0.X+1`).

## [0.0.4] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- The chat composer's attachment button now offers "Take Photo" alongside
  "Photo Library", so you can capture an image with the camera without
  leaving the chat. (`PupaApp` `0.0.92`)

### Changed

- Settings now keeps all tool permissions in one "Tools" submenu (shell-command
  approval + per-tool backend toggles) instead of splitting them across
  separate "Security" and "Developer" sections. (`PupaApp` `0.0.92`)
- The default first-launch example is now the Wellbeing Coach workspace instead
  of Job Search. (`PupaApp` `0.0.92`)
- MyApp rows in the menu start collapsed and only expand when you tap the
  chevron — they no longer auto-open (and no longer re-open when you return from
  a pushed section). (`PupaApp` `0.0.92`)

### Fixed

- The Orchestrator landing page icon now uses the same purple as the menu
  row and agent picker, instead of system blue. (`PupaApp` `0.0.92`)
- The Orchestrator footer row blends with the menu's bottom bar (a single
  hairline divider) instead of reading as a raised white card. (`PupaApp`
  `0.0.92`)
- The sidebar info popovers no longer clip their last line of text. (`PupaApp`
  `0.0.92`)
- On iPad (and large iPhones in landscape) the slide-in menu stays a slim
  fixed width instead of covering most of the screen. (`PupaApp` `0.0.92`)
- On iPhone in landscape, the chat composer no longer hides behind the
  keyboard — the floating chat card lifts and shrinks to keep the input
  visible. (`PupaApp` `0.0.92`)
- The slide-in menu's brand header no longer renders under the status-bar
  clock: the panel background still bleeds to the screen edge, but its
  content keeps its safe-area insets. (`PupaApp` `0.0.92`)

## [0.0.3] — 2026-06-02

### Changed

- Conversation threads are now switched from a dropdown in the chat panel
  header instead of a confusing horizontal swipe-pager. The dropdown lists
  every thread (active one checkmarked) and offers "Delete this
  conversation"; the `+` button still starts a new one. (`PupaApp` `0.0.91`)
- Settings is reorganised into drill-down subsections (Backend, Security,
  Examples, Developer): the sheet opens to a category list and each row
  pushes a screen with that category's controls, instead of one long flat
  form. (`PupaApp` `0.0.91`)
- The sidebar's Settings button is larger and easier to hit. (`PupaApp`
  `0.0.91`)
- The Orchestrator collapses into a slim footer row pinned to the bottom of
  the menu (tap the chevron to reveal its memories) instead of a heavy
  separated section, keeping the menu clean. (`PupaApp` `0.0.91`)
- On iOS the menu opens on first launch and then remembers its last
  open/closed state across launches. (`PupaApp` `0.0.91`)

## [0.0.2] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Launch splash no longer lets the app show through (opaque backing
  behind the brand gradient) and now plays as a strict sequence: splash
  fades fully out onto a neutral surface before the onboarding fades in,
  so the splash and onboarding never blend and the app never flashes
  during the handoff. (`PupaApp` `0.0.90`)

## [0.0.1] — 2026-06-01

### Added

- Initial extraction of the Pupa iOS / macOS client into a standalone
  repo. Contains the SwiftUI app (`Pupa/` — `PupaApp` `0.0.89`), the
  standalone AG-UI Swift Package (`AGUIKit/` — `0.0.20`), the Xcode host
  project (`PupaHost/`) used for TestFlight builds, the
  `testflight-release` skill under `.claude/skills/`, and the
  architecture + "adding a new component" docs.

  Internal sub-package versions (in `Pupa/Sources/PupaApp/Version.swift`
  and `AGUIKit/Sources/AGUIKit/Version.swift`) carry forward from the
  monorepo so TestFlight build tracking and AGUIKit consumers keep
  working. Only the **root project version** restarts at `0.0.1` here.
  The backend now lives in its own repo
  ([pupa-app/pupa-backend](https://github.com/pupa-app/pupa-backend)).
